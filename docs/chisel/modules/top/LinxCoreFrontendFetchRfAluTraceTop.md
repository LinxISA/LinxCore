## Purpose

`LinxCoreFrontendFetchRfAluTraceTop` is the R95 live-source successor to
`LinxCoreFrontendRfAluTraceTop`. It removes the testbench-owned
`FrontendDecodePacket` fixture from the RF-backed scalar path. A Chisel
`FrontendFetchPacketSource` now owns PC request/response packetization, feeds
F4, and advances its PC from F4's decoded byte count. The decoded row then
passes through reduced decode/rename/ROB allocation, reduced scalar issue,
RF-backed source reads, reduced ALU execute, RF writeback, and monitored ROB
commit.

The top proves one more replacement step on the CoreMark path: the harness now
serves instruction bytes through reusable binary or sparse fetch-memory image
paths, and the frontend packet row is created by Chisel logic. R97 adds a
little-endian ELF64 PT_LOAD extractor that writes a sparse address-to-byte
image for high-address or non-contiguous program segments. R98 moves the
expected PC/instruction/source/writeback rows out of the C++ harness and into a
QEMU-shaped JSONL file selected by `FETCH_EXPECTED_ROWS` or the default
`fixture.expected.jsonl`. R99 adds `FETCH_QEMU_TRACE`, which normalizes an
existing QEMU commit JSONL and extracts a strict sequential reduced-scalar
prefix into `qemu.expected.jsonl`. R100 adds a live direct-boot ELF wrapper
that captures a bounded QEMU commit prefix, validates the selected rows through
that same R99 reducer, and pairs the rows with the ELF sparse fetch-memory path
for matching PC/instruction bytes. R101 lets the same live ELF gate run without
PC filters for the legal entry and exit block markers: `C.BSTART` and
`C.BSTOP` rows are preserved in the expected stream as DUT-only skip rows,
consumed by the reduced `DecodeRenameROBPath`, and omitted from the
architectural QEMU/DUT commit comparison. The top still injects a
single-instruction response terminator after each expected instruction length,
so it is not dense packet or full QEMU equivalence. Block-header execution,
dense multi-slot packet handling, full issue arbitration, LSU, trap/recovery,
and branch restart are still outside this reduced top.

## State

The wrapper owns only composition wiring. State remains in child modules:

- `FrontendFetchPacketSource`: active PC, one-outstanding request state,
  response packet residency, packet UID/checkpoint, restart, and flush clearing.
- `F4DecodeWindow`: combinational instruction-window slicing and decoded byte
  count.
- `DecodeRenameROBPath`: decode-to-rename queue, scalar/T-U rename, reduced
  ROB/BROB allocation, completion, commit, and deallocation.
- `ReducedScalarRegisterFile`: physical scalar data and ready bits.
- `ReducedScalarIssueQueue` and `ReducedScalarIssuePick`: resident issue rows,
  source-ready snapshots, P1/I1/I2 timing, issued-entry lock, cancel, and W2
  release.
- `ReducedScalarAluExecute`: reduced scalar ADD/ADDI/MOVR/MOVI execute and
  writeback-shaped completion.

## Logic Design

`FrontendFetchPacketSource` issues a PC request after `startValid` or
`restartValid`. The bounded Verilator fixture accepts the request, reads the
instruction bytes for that PC from a `FetchMemoryImage`, and returns a 64-bit
single-instruction window. The memory image can be a base-addressed binary blob
or a sparse address-to-byte map extracted from ELF PT_LOAD segments. The source
captures that response as a
`FrontendDecodePacket` and presents it to F4 only when `DecodeRenameROBPath`
can accept the packet. F4's `totalLenBytes` feeds back as `advanceBytes`, so
the source advances by the decoded instruction size instead of by a fixed
fixture stride.

The F4 output is consumed by `DecodeRenameROBPath`, which reserves and updates
ROB rows, then emits a renamed scalar uop into `ReducedScalarIssueQueue`.
For R101 live-QEMU evidence, this top instantiates `DecodeRenameROBPath` with
`skipBlockMarkers=true`. A single-instruction `BSTART` or `BSTOP` response
therefore advances the fetch source and drives `blockMarkerSkipFire` without
allocating a ROB row or entering issue. A response window that decodes both a
marker and scalar row is not consumed; dense packet support must first add a
multi-slot enqueue and compare contract.
Rename acceptance remains queue-capacity driven. RF physical source readiness
is sampled by the issue queue and gates issue from resident rows, not frontend
packet acceptance. The P1/I1/I2 picker reads source data from
`ReducedScalarRegisterFile` and presents confirmed data to
`ReducedScalarAluExecute`.

On completion, the ALU sends a completion row to `DecodeRenameROBPath`, writes
the destination physical tag in the reduced RF, and releases the issue-queue
entry by `(bid, rid, stid)`. The monitored commit row then carries the original
PC/instruction, source architectural tags and data, destination/writeback data,
model `(bid,gid,rid)` identity, and hardware `blockBid` sideband through the
shared JSONL writer.

## Model Alignment

The C++ model flow being reduced here is:

1. IFU F0/F2/F3/F4/F5 stages create decode bundles from PC request/response
   state and instruction-size metadata.
2. `DCTop::Work` and `SPEROB::allocROB` allocate ROB identity before the row
   enters rename.
3. `GPRRename` maps scalar architectural sources to physical tags and
   allocates physical destinations.
4. The issue path keeps renamed rows resident, initializes source readiness
   from the ready table, selects ready rows, reads RF data in the issue pipe,
   and releases issued rows after pipe completion.
5. `ALUPipe::Work` publishes W2 writeback/completion; commit preserves
   `CommitInfo(bid,gid,rid)` separately from hardware block identity.

The reduced Chisel top preserves those ownership boundaries for a serialized
scalar smoke. The R96/R97 memory feeders remove direct instruction-word
injection from the response driver and allow sparse ELF-backed program bytes.
R98 separates expected row ownership from the harness: a JSONL row stream now
provides the PC, instruction, length, scalar source data, and writeback
expectations that the reduced top can execute. R99 allows that stream to come
from an already captured QEMU commit trace when the first rows are the strict
reduced scalar subset. The extractor rejects unsupported opcodes, memory or
trap rows, non-scalar GPR aliases, non-sequential `next_pc`, and result
mismatches before the Verilator harness sees the rows. R100 automates that
path for a direct-boot ELF: the wrapper captures a bounded live QEMU JSONL
prefix through a FIFO, optionally applies a PC filter to skip legal block
headers until this reduced top can execute them, then runs the existing
`FETCH_ELF` plus `FETCH_QEMU_TRACE` gate. R101 adds an
`--allow-block-markers`/`FETCH_QEMU_ALLOW_BLOCK_MARKERS=1` path that preserves
legal `BSTART`/`BSTOP` rows as `skip` entries. The harness still serves those
rows to the DUT and asserts marker diagnostics, but only scalar reduced ALU
rows are written into the QEMU/DUT comparator streams. This top still does not
model
cacheline merge, branch prediction, multiple
outstanding fetches, dense multi-slot decode, full oldest-ready issue
preferences, read-port arbitration, bypass, load speculative wakeup, LSU,
precise traps, or architectural redirect restart.

## Trace/Observability

`tools/chisel/run_chisel_frontend_fetch_rf_alu_trace_top_xcheck.sh` emits the
top, builds every emitted SystemVerilog file with Verilator, and runs
`frontend_fetch_rf_alu_trace_top_tb.cpp`. The driver:

- preloads initial reduced RF data from the first expected source read for any
  architectural register that has not already been produced by an earlier row;
- emits `generated/chisel-frontend-fetch-rf-alu-trace-top-xcheck/fixture.fetch.bin`
  with dense little-endian instruction bytes unless `FETCH_MEMORY_BIN` points
  at another binary image;
- when `FETCH_ELF` is set, extracts ELF64 little-endian PT_LOAD segments into
  `generated/chisel-frontend-fetch-rf-alu-trace-top-xcheck/elf.fetch.mem` or
  `FETCH_MEMORY_HEX`, then passes that sparse image to the harness;
- accepts `FETCH_MEMORY_HEX` directly for sparse address-to-byte memory tests;
- emits `generated/chisel-frontend-fetch-rf-alu-trace-top-xcheck/fixture.expected.jsonl`
  unless `FETCH_EXPECTED_ROWS` points at another QEMU-shaped expected-row file;
- when `FETCH_QEMU_TRACE` points at a QEMU commit JSONL, runs
  `frontend_fetch_rf_alu_qemu_rows.py` to produce
  `generated/chisel-frontend-fetch-rf-alu-trace-top-xcheck/qemu.expected.jsonl`;
- accepts `FETCH_QEMU_MAX_ROWS` to cap the extracted strict reduced-scalar row
  prefix, with `0` meaning all normalized input rows;
- accepts `FETCH_QEMU_ALLOW_BLOCK_MARKERS=1` to preserve legal `BSTART`/`BSTOP`
  rows as DUT-only skip entries in `qemu.expected.jsonl`;
- starts the live source at the first expected row PC;
- serves one bounded instruction window per source PC request by reading bytes
  from the fetch-memory image and appending the single-instruction terminator
  after the expected length;
- requires `sourceOutFire`, `f4ValidMask == 0x1`, and
  `sourceAdvanceBytes == instruction length`;
- for skip rows, requires `blockMarkerSkipFire`, matching marker
  PC/instruction/length and boundary/stop diagnostics, and no ROB allocation
  or issue enqueue;
- waits for issue enqueue, ALU completion, and one commit row per instruction;
- writes QEMU-shaped reference and DUT JSONL through
  `tools/chisel/commit_trace_jsonl.h`;
- compares `ADD r3,r4,r5`, `ADDI r6,r3,0x7ff`, and `C.MOVR r5,r6` through the
  neutral comparator.

The default wrapper manifest at
`generated/chisel-frontend-fetch-rf-alu-trace-top-xcheck/report/crosscheck_manifest.json`
records `status: "pass"`, `compared_rows: 3`, and `mismatch_count: 0`.

`tools/chisel/build_frontend_fetch_rf_alu_qemu_fixture_elf.sh` builds a tiny
legal-entry direct-boot ELF:

```text
C.BSTART.STD; ADD; ADDI; C.MOVR; C.BSTOP
```

The R100 gate runs:

```bash
bash tools/chisel/run_chisel_frontend_fetch_rf_alu_qemu_elf_xcheck.sh \
  --elf generated/r100-live-qemu-fixture/frontend_fetch_rf_alu_qemu_fixture.elf \
  --expected-rows 3 \
  --capture-rows 3 \
  --pc-lo 0x10002 \
  --pc-hi 0x1000b \
  --max-seconds 5
```

The PC filter selects the scalar prefix after the legal entry `BSTART` until
block-header execution is live in this reduced top. QEMU termination by
signal after the bounded rows are captured is expected; the pass/fail source is
the manifest. The R100 manifest at
`generated/chisel-frontend-fetch-rf-alu-qemu-elf-xcheck/report/crosscheck_manifest.json`
records `status: "pass"`, `compared_rows: 3`, and `mismatch_count: 0`.

The R101 block-marker gate runs the same ELF without PC filters:

```bash
bash tools/chisel/run_chisel_frontend_fetch_rf_alu_qemu_elf_xcheck.sh \
  --elf generated/r101-live-qemu-fixture/frontend_fetch_rf_alu_qemu_fixture.elf \
  --expected-rows 0 \
  --capture-rows 5 \
  --allow-block-markers \
  --max-seconds 5
```

The preview stream preserves five QEMU rows: `C.BSTART` at `0x10000` as a
skip row, scalar rows at `0x10002`, `0x10006`, and `0x1000a`, and `C.BSTOP`
at `0x1000c` as a skip row. The comparator manifest still records only the
three architectural scalar commits: `status: "pass"`, `compared_rows: 3`, and
`mismatch_count: 0`.
