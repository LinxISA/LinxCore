# Chisel mainline execution ledger

This ledger records the evidence and workflow boundary of each implementation
loop in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-31-core-mainline-restructure.md`. Commit and
push identities are filled only after the corresponding operation succeeds.

## Loop 1 — NDF contract spine and reference boundary

- Scope: Task 1 only; documentation contracts and their executable checker.
- Skills: repository-pinned `using-superpowers`, `executing-plans`,
  `test-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`,
  `verification-before-completion`, and the `linx-core` domain workflow.
- Workflow: confirm a clean dedicated branch; run the existing Chisel baseline;
  add checker tests; observe the expected missing-checker RED; implement the
  smallest dependency-free checker; create the live clause spine and pinned
  reference projections; run focused, local-reference, and Chisel regression
  gates.
- RED evidence: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_ndf_profile -v` failed all
  seven cases because `tools/spec/check_ndf_profile.py` did not exist.
- GREEN evidence: nine checker tests pass; the live profile reports 27
  clauses, 13 L1 MUST clauses, 13 covered requirements, zero open questions,
  and two pinned structural-method references. Strict local-reference
  verification reports the same result. `bash tools/chisel/build_chisel.sh`
  completes successfully.
- Debug evidence: strict source verification initially treated a checkout HEAD
  as the pinned Git identity. Read-only inspection proved that the pinned
  commit object existed on another ref. A new regression test now requires
  object identity rather than working-branch identity. A second regression
  test ensures malformed local-reference metadata reports validation errors
  without a Python traceback.
- Result: the contract hierarchy, ownership rules, pipeline boundary, reference
  boundary, and executable profile check are established without changing RTL.
- Remaining gap: RTL still follows the pre-restructure hierarchy. Task 2 owns
  the centralized parameter profiles and is the next loop.
- skill-evolve: no-update — this loop adds a repository-specific documentation
  profile and does not discover a reusable LinxCore hardware invariant beyond
  the existing domain skill.
- Branch: `codex/chisel-gap-superpowers`
- Commit: the enclosing Lore commit with intent
  `Make the core contract independently reviewable before RTL moves`.
- Push target: `origin/codex/chisel-gap-superpowers`; exact commit and remote
  equality are recorded in the loop handoff after the immutable commit exists.
