# Chisel mainline execution ledger

This ledger records the evidence and workflow boundary of each implementation
loop in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-31-core-mainline-restructure.md`. Commit and
push identities are filled only after the corresponding operation succeeds.

## Loop 1 — NDF contract spine and reference boundary

- Scope: Task 1 only; documentation contracts and their executable checker.
- Skills: repository-pinned `using-superpowers`, `executing-plans`,
  `test-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`,
  `verification-before-completion`, and the `linx-core` domain workflow.
- Workflow: confirm a clean dedicated branch; run the existing Chisel baseline;
  add checker tests; observe the expected missing-checker RED; implement the
  smallest dependency-free checker; create the live clause spine and pinned
  reference projections; run focused, local-reference, and Chisel regression
  gates.
- RED evidence: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_ndf_profile -v` failed all
  seven cases because `tools/spec/check_ndf_profile.py` did not exist.
- GREEN evidence: nine checker tests pass; the live profile reports 27
  clauses, 13 L1 MUST clauses, 13 covered requirements, zero open questions,
  and two pinned structural-method references. Strict local-reference
  verification reports the same result. `bash tools/chisel/build_chisel.sh`
  completes successfully.
- Debug evidence: strict source verification initially treated a checkout HEAD
  as the pinned Git identity. Read-only inspection proved that the pinned
  commit object existed on another ref. A new regression test now requires
  object identity rather than working-branch identity. A second regression
  test ensures malformed local-reference metadata reports validation errors
  without a Python traceback.
- Result: the contract hierarchy, ownership rules, pipeline boundary, reference
  boundary, and executable profile check are established without changing RTL.
- Remaining gap: RTL still follows the pre-restructure hierarchy. Task 2 owns
  the centralized parameter profiles and is the next loop.
- skill-evolve: no-update — this loop adds a repository-specific documentation
  profile and does not discover a reusable LinxCore hardware invariant beyond
  the existing domain skill.
- Branch: `codex/chisel-gap-superpowers`
- Commit: the enclosing Lore commit with intent
  `Make the core contract independently reviewable before RTL moves`.
- Push target: `origin/codex/chisel-gap-superpowers`; exact commit and remote
  equality are recorded in the loop handoff after the immutable commit exists.

## Loop 2 — Central parameters and configurable profiles

- Scope: Task 2 plus the NDF interface-contract refinement requested while the
  loop was active; no box state or datapath was migrated.
- Skills: repository-pinned `using-superpowers`, `executing-plans`,
  `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, and the
  `linx-core` domain workflow.
- Workflow: add the W2/W4/W6/W8 profile test first; observe missing central
  parameter types; implement immutable module records and cross-parameter
  checks; add value-only legacy adapters behind their own RED/GREEN cycle;
  expose and close the old OOO W8 sizing gaps; project parameter options,
  coupling and verification into the local NDF profile; expand Task 3 with
  boundary homes and L1/L2/L3 interface acceptance.
- RED evidence: `CoreConfigurationSpec` first failed because
  `linxcore.params`, profiles and adapters did not exist. A later adapter test
  failed first on the old 2/4/6 decode-width restriction, then on W8
  store-commit and PC-bank capacity. The new NDF coupling test failed because
  `couples-with` was not yet a checked edge.
- GREEN evidence: `CoreConfigurationSpec` passes 9 tests, including all four
  profiles, invalid combinations, topology defaults and value-only adapters.
  `OooParamsSpec` passes 3 tests including W8 decode construction.
  `CoreParamsInterfaceClosureSpec` passes 2 compatibility tests.
  The 10 NDF-checker tests pass; the live profile reports 37 clauses, 17 L1
  MUST clauses, 18 verification targets, zero open questions and two pinned
  references under both ordinary and strict local-reference checks.
  `bash tools/chisel/build_chisel.sh` completes successfully.
- Result: the central parameter boundary now owns principal widths, module
  resources and validation. W4 preserves the requested IEX/LSU topology;
  W2/W4/W6/W8 are constructible profiles. Temporary adapters derive dependent
  legacy capacities but own no state.
- Interface-plan refinement: Task 3 now freezes eight contract homes
  (IFU–CTU, CTU–OOO, OOO–IEX, IEX–LSU, recovery, commit, DTU and memory),
  requires stable NDF IDs and typed edges, and separates L1 observable
  contracts, L2 Bundle mechanisms and L3 executable checks. Generated
  manifests remain projections of elaborated Bundles rather than a competing
  field source.
- Remaining gap: the typed Bundles, complete box IOs and generated manifest do
  not exist yet. Task 3 owns that implementation.
- skill-evolve: no-update — width/resource coupling is specific to this core;
  no new reusable invariant is needed in the shared LinxCore skill.
- Branch: `codex/chisel-gap-superpowers`
- Commit: the enclosing Lore commit with intent
  `Keep every width and resource choice explicit at one boundary`.
- Push target: `origin/codex/chisel-gap-superpowers`; exact commit and remote
  equality are recorded in the loop handoff after the immutable commit exists.
